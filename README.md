# Deis

Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon [Docker](http://docker.io/) and [CoreOS](http://coreos.com) to provide a lightweight PaaS with a [Heroku-inspired](http://heroku.com) workflow.

# Deploying Deis

Deis is a set of Docker containers that can be deployed anywhere including public cloud, private cloud, bare metal or your workstation. Decide where you'd like to deploy Deis, then follow the deployment-specific documentation for [Rackspace](contrib/rackspace/README.md), [EC2](contrib/ec2/README.md), or [bare-metal](contrib/bare-metal/README.md) provisioning. Documentation for other platforms is forthcoming. Want to see a particular platform supported? Open an [issue](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues/new) and we'll investigate.

Trying out Deis? Continue following these instructions for a local cluster setup. This is also a great Deis testing/development environment.

# Upgrading Deis

Upgrading from a previous Deis release? See [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md) for additional information.

## Install prerequisites
On your workstation:
* Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* Install the fleetctl client: Install v0.2.0 from the [fleet GitHub page](https://github.com/coreos/fleet/releases).
* Install the Docker client if you want to run Docker commands locally (optional)

If you're on Ubuntu, you need to install the nfs-kernel-server package as it's required for sharing folders between your host and your CoreOS VM:

    sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server

## Additional setup for a multi-node cluster
If you'd like to spin up more than one VM to test an entire cluster, there are a few additional prerequisites:
* Edit [contrib/coreos/user-data](contrib/coreos/user-data) and add a unique discovery URL generated from `https://discovery.etcd.io/new`
* Set `DEIS_NUM_INSTANCES` to the desired size of your cluster (typically 3 or 5): ```$ export DEIS_NUM_INSTANCES=3```
* Instead of `local.deisapp.com`, use either `local3.deisapp.com` or `local5.deisapp.com` as your hostname for accessing the cluster

Note that for scheduling to work properly, clusters must consist of at least 3 nodes and always have an odd number of members.
For more information, see [optimal etcd cluster size](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/optimal-cluster-size.md).

Deis clusters of less than 3 nodes are unsupported for anything other than local development.

## Boot CoreOS

First, start the CoreOS cluster on VirtualBox. From a command prompt, `cd` to the root of the Deis project code and type:

```console
$ vagrant up
```

This instructs Vagrant to spin up each VM. To be able to connect to the VMs, you must add your Vagrant-generated SSH key to the ssh-agent (fleetctl tunnel requires the agent to have this key):
```console
$ ssh-add ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
```

Export some environment variables so you can connect to the VM using the `docker` and `fleetctl` clients on your workstation.

```console
$ export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.8.100:4243
$ export FLEETCTL_TUNNEL=172.17.8.100
```

## Build Deis

Use `make pull` to download cached layers from the public Docker Index.  Then use `make build` to assemble all of the Deis components from Dockerfiles.  Grab some coffee while it builds the images on each VM (it can take a while).

```console
$ make pull
$ make build
```

## Run Deis

Use `make run` to start all Deis containers and attach to their log output. This can take some time - the registry service will pull and prepare a Docker image. Grab some more coffee!

```console
$ make run
```

Your Vagrant VM is accessible at `local.deisapp.com` (or `local3.deisapp.com`/`local5.deisapp.com`). For clusters on other platforms (EC2, Rackspace, bare metal, etc.), see our guide to [Configuring DNS](http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/operations/configure-dns/).

## Testing the cluster
Integration tests and corresponding documentation can be found under the `test/` folder.

These systemd services run the various containers which compose Deis, and can be stopped on a machine with `sudo systemctl stop servicename`.
* deis-builder.service
* deis-cache.service
* deis-controller.service
* deis-database.service
* deis-discovery.service
* deis-logger.service
* deis-registry.service
* deis-router.service

Logging into one of the CoreOS machines and stopping a container service should cause the same component on another CoreOS
host to take over as master.
Similarly, bringing down a VM should enable the services on another VM to take over as master.

## Install the Deis Client
If you're using the latest Deis release, use `pip install deis` to install the latest [Deis Client](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deis/) or download [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/deis/deis/tree/master/client#get-started).

If you're working off master, precompiled binaries are likely out of date. You should either symlink the python file directly or build a local copy of the client:

```console
$ ln -fs $(pwd)/client/deis.py /usr/local/bin/deis
```
or
```console
$ cd client && python setup.py install
```

## Register a User

Use the Deis Client to register a new user.

```console
$ deis register http://local.deisapp.com:8000
$ deis keys:add
```

Use `deis keys:add` to add your SSH public key for `git push` access.

## Initialize a Cluster

Initialize a `dev` cluster with a list of CoreOS hosts and your CoreOS private key.

```console
$ deis clusters:create dev local.deisapp.com --hosts=local.deisapp.com --auth=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
```

The parameters to `deis clusters:create` are:
* cluster name (`dev`) - the name used by Deis to reference the cluster
* cluster hostname (`local.deisapp.com`) - the hostname under which apps are created, like `balancing-giraffe.local.deisapp.com`
* cluster members (`--hosts`) - a comma-separated list of cluster members -- not necessarily all members, but at least one (for EC2 and Rackspace, this is a list of the internal IPs like `--hosts=10.21.12.1,10.21.12.2,10.21.12.3`)
* auth SSH key (`--auth`) - the SSH private key used to provision servers (for EC2 and Rackspace, this key is likely `~/.ssh/deis`)

The `dev` cluster will be used as the default cluster for future `deis` commands.

# Usage

## Create an Application
Create an application on the default `dev` cluster.

```console
$ deis create
```

Use `deis create --cluster=prod` to place the app on a different cluster.  Don't like our name-generator?  Use `deis create myappname`.

## Push
Push builds of your application from your local git repository or from a Docker Registry.  Each build creates a new release, which can be rolled back.

#### From a Git Repository
When you created the application, a git remote for Deis was added automatically.

```console
$ git push deis master
```
This will use the Deis builder to package your application as a Docker Image and deploy it on your application's cluster.

## Configure
Configure your application with environment variables.  Each config change also creates a new release.

```console
$ deis config:set DATABASE_URL=postgres://
```

Coming soon: Use the integrated ETCD namespace for service discovery between applications on the same cluster.

## Test
### Run tests
Test your application by running commands inside an ephemeral Docker container.

```console
$ deis run make test
```

To integrate with your CI system, check the return code.

## Scale
Scale containers horizontally with ease.

```console
$ deis scale web=8
```

## Debug
Access to aggregated logs makes it easy to troubleshoot problems with your application.

```console
$ deis logs
```

Use `deis run` to execute one-off commands and explore the deployed container.  Coming soon: `deis attach` to jump into a live container.

## Known Issues

We have sometimes seen the VM reboot while doing `make build` against a
Vagrant virtual machine. If you see this issue using a recent version of
Vagrant and the current master version of Deis, please add to the issue
report at https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant/issues/68 to help us
pin it down.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues that users have run into when provisioning Deis are detailed below.

#### When running a `make` action - 'Failed initializing SSH client: ssh: handshake failed: ssh: unable to authenticate'
Did you remember to add your SSH key to the ssh-agent? `ssh-agent -L` should list the key you used to provision the servers. If it's not there, `ssh-add -K /path/to/your/key`.

#### When running a `make` action - 'All the given peers are not reachable (Tried to connect to each peer twice and failed)'
The most common cause of this issue is that a [new discovery URL](https://discovery.etcd.io/new) wasn't generated and updated in [contrib/coreos/user-data](contrib/coreos/user-data) before the cluster was launched. Each Deis cluster must have a unique discovery URL, else there will be entries for old hosts that etcd will try and fail to connect to. Destroy and relaunch the cluster, ensuring to use a fresh discovery URL.

#### Various NFS issues, specifically an 'access denied' error
The easiest workaround for this is to use rsync instead of NFS. In the Vagrantfile, swap out the `config.vm.synced_folder` line for the commented version.

#### Scaling an app doesn't work, and/or the app shows 'Welcome to nginx!'
This means the controller failed to submit jobs for the app to fleet. `fleetctl status deis-controller` will show detailed error information, but the most common cause of this is that the cluster was created with the wrong SSH key for the `--auth` parameter. The key supplied with the `--auth` parameter must be the same key that was used to provision the Deis servers. If you suspect this to be the issue, you'll need to `clusters:destroy` the cluster and recreate it, along with the app.

#### A Deis component fails to start
Use `fleetctl status deis-<component>.service` to get the output of the service. The most common cause of services failing to start are sporadic issues with the Docker index. The telltale sign of this is:

```console
May 12 18:24:37 deis-3 systemd[1]: Starting deis-controller...
May 12 18:24:37 deis-3 sh[6176]: 2014/05/12 18:24:37 Error: No such id: deis/controller
May 12 18:24:37 deis-3 sh[6176]: Pulling repository deis/controller
May 12 18:29:47 deis-3 sh[6176]: 2014/05/12 18:29:47 Could not find repository on any of the indexed registries.
May 12 18:29:47 deis-3 systemd[1]: deis-controller.service: control process exited, code=exited status=1
May 12 18:29:47 deis-3 systemd[1]: Failed to start deis-controller.
May 12 18:29:47 deis-3 systemd[1]: Unit deis-controller.service entered failed state.
```

We are exploring workarounds and are working with the Docker team to improve their index. In the meantime, try starting the service again with `fleetctl start deis-<component>.service`.
